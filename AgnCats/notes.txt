Overview of the catalogue generation

Parent: Legacy Survey - target selection

 - Parent = 5 * QSOMaker catalogues (QSO, ELG, LRG, BGS, star)
   - this cat gives us the redshifts (RR or QN/RR) and some QSO identifiers

   - Choose these with thresholds

   - Combine DESI observed with with FastSpecFit (check no of targets for FastSpevFit and QSOmaker - are they both run on everything?)

 - Combine with X-ray, Radio and WISE
