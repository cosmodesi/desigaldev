# desigaldev
DESI Galaxy Science Working Group development

This repo is to develop scripts and notebooks for the Galaxy & Quasar Physics (GQP) working group. Once the code is finalized, it can be moved to the official `desihub` repo instead of `cosmodesi`.

- `AgnCats/` holds code and example notebooks for creating AGN Catalogs (including AGN classification).
- `LGal_spec/` includes an example notebook to use LGal mocks.
